## Chat
In Cyber Code Online, there's 3 types of chat: 
- Global (or General Chat) - where everyone can chat freely and interact with each other;
- Gang - where only the members of the gang can chat and see the messages sent in that channel;
- Private Message (Mail) - where you can privately chat with only one person that you want, at a time.

In order to mention (or tag) someone in the Global chat, you can use '@' and the name of the user.
As you type their name, a list will appear and you can select the desired name from that list.

The player mentioned by you, will receive a notification on their phone knowing that you wanted to talk to him/her.

The mention function does not work in the Private Message (Mail) chat.

## Profile
In your Profile there's several information and options at your disposal.

You can view your Alias (username), BTC (Bitcoin), Gear level, Location, System Link (Online or Offline), Status, your general level, Skills and Stats, Gang (if you are in one, otherwise this section won't exist in your profile), Inventory and Secret Keys.

At the [STATS] you can see the 'Global Effects' of an activated Transmitter (whether it is a Synaptic Accelerator, Exploit or Frontal Cortex Optimization one).

Here you can also see, in case you get muted by the moderators, how long the [MUTED] status will last (how long it will take until you can chat in the Global chat, Gang or send PMs).

You also have an option to:
- [DONATE] - which will take you to the Donation Tiers;
- [QUIT GANG] - in case you are in a gang;
- [LOGOUT] - this will log you out of the game.

On other players profile, you will encounter different options:
- [SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE] - it allows you to send a private message through the in-game Mail;
- [SEND GIFT] - it allows you to send items from your inventory to the player;
- [INVITE TO GANG] - you can invite the player only if you are the leader of the gang or you, as the leader, gave permission to each gang members to invite others players into the gang;
- [ADD TO FRIEND LIST] - this will simply add the player to your friend lists (without needing an acceptance from the player) and if the player is not inside the game, they will also receive a notification about the fact that you added him/her as friend.
