## Secret Keys
Each main level area of the game consists of 3 smaller areas each having a normal and a challenge dungeon. When completing a normal dungeon, in the prize room you will find a dungeon key fragment. Once you collect all 3 key fragments from all 3 dungeons from those areas, you will have the ability to craft a Secret Key that will grand access to the next main level area of the game. You can craft a Secret Key by going to the Terminal, located in the Shangri-La City Center (main HUB of the game) and merging all 3 key fragments together. The new area unlocked by the Secret Key will include a new list of leveled enemies and dungeons to explore.  
  
This is the main progression of the game and dungeons will continue to level with you. However if your player level is 13 levels or more, below the dungeons recommended level you won't be able to join. Same thing applies if you are 13 levels above the recommended dungeon level. In this case, you won't be able to interact with anything inside the dungeon, including quest givers and loot. So be sure to use the challenge dungeons to up your player level.
