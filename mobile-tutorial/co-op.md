## Dungeon Co-op

Currently, the only form of co-op in this game is through dungeon co-op.

Dungeons can be found in the 'Adventure' area underneath the list of enemies. When in a dungeon you can click 'Send invite to global chat' and a message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that appears to join other peoples dungeons. When an enemy is killed with the help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance at a reward. All crates are unique to each player. In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, the player's level cannot be 12 levels higher than the dungeon and 9 levels lower than the dungeon.

When you die in a dungeon, to the regular enemy or boss, you cannot rejoin your dungeon.

When starting a dungeon, you can leave it as Public (if you swipe it, the dungeon will become private, meaning that nobody can join your dungeon) and you can set a
Password, so only your friends or gang members can join based on the password that you will provide.

All public dungeons can be seen and joined if you access the floating menu (the 3 horizontal lines menu) anywhere from the game, besides the General Chat and click on the 2 buildings symbol.
